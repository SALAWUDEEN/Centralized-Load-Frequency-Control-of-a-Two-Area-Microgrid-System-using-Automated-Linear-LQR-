# Centralized-Load-Frequency-Control-of-a-Two-Area-Microgrid-System-using-Automated-Linear-LQR-
In this repository, I designed a novel method for selecting the Q and R matrices of LQR controller through dynamic programing. I then use the automatited LQR controller to design an optimal control strategy for the frequency control of a two area microgrid system operating under  various disturbance.
